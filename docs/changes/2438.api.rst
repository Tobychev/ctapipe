Change how the ``DataWriter`` writes pointing information.
Before, each unique pointing position was written in a table
with the event time as index column into ``dl1/monitoring/telescope/pointing``.

This has two issues: For observed data, each pointing will be unique
in horizontal coordinates due to tracking a fixed ICRS coordinate.
Resulting in a pointing position written for each event, although the
resolution of the monitoring is much lower.
For simulated events, the event time is the timestamp of the simulation
and pointing is fixed in ``AltAz``.
``ctapipe`` was using the closest point in time for simulated events when
reading data back in, however, this is problematic in case of many 
simulation runs processed in parallel.

We now store the first received pointing information
in the ``configuration/telescope/pointing`` table per obs id,
only for simulation events.
