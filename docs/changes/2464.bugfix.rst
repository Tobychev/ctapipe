Properly transform pixel coordinates between ``CameraFrame``
and ``TelescopeFrame`` in ``MuonIntensityFitter`` taking.
Before, ``MuonIntensityFitter`` always used the equivalent focal
length for transformations, now it is using the focal length
attached to the ``CameraGeometry``, thus respecting the
``focal_length_choice`` options of the event sources.
