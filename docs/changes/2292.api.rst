Changed  `ReconstructionProperties` into a enum of `Flag` type, meaning a reconstructor can say it provides both geometry and particle type by setting
`self.property = ReconstructionProperty.ENERGY | ReconstructionProperty.PARTICLE_TYPE`

It is also possible to pick out a list of properties a reconstructor supports given a flag combination in `self.property` using this (slightly unreadable) list comprehension

.. code:: python
        properties = [
            self.property & itm
            for itm in self.supported
            if self.property & itm in ReconstructionProperty
        ]
