Change default behaviour of `run_rool`:

1. The default value of `raises` is now `True`. That means, when using
   `run_tool`, the Exceptions raised by a Tool will be re-raised. The raised
   exceptions can be tested for their type and content.
   If the Tool must fail and only the non-zero error case is important to test,
   set `raises=False` (as it was before).

2. If the `cwd` parameter is `None` (as per default), now a temporary directory
   is used instead of the directory, where `run_tool` is called (typically via
   pytest). This way, log-files and other output files don't clutter your
   working space.
