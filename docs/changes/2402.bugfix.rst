Ensure that ``SubarrayDescription.reference_location`` is always generated by
```SimTelEventSource``, even if the metadata is missing. In that case, construct a
dummy location with the correct observatory height and latitude and longitude
equal to zero ("Null Island").

From now one require that ``SubarrayDescriptions`` contain a reference_location
when they are constructed
